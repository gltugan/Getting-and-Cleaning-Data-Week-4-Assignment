### Data Description:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 


### Steps:
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5)From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent **tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

**Tidydata.txt file is a independent tidy data set which created though training and test data sets.**


### Descripton

- Data: In Working Directory : "./tidydata.txt"

- Data in table consist of 180 rows and 68 columns

### Identifiers

- Subject: An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. 30 Subject are numbered from 1 to 30 (%30 test, %70 training)

- Activiy: Each subject performed six activities. Type of activities are numbered from 1 to 6 as listed below.

1: WALKING
2: WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3: WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4: SITTING
5: STANDING
6: LAYING
